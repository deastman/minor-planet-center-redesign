Minor Planet Center Redesign

I completed the website redesign of the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center website in 2013. The overall goals of the redesign were to overhaul the site's organization, streamline navigation, and divide content for core audience. 

The live website can be viewed here: https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/
